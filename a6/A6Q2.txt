Question A6Q2 - 1. Planning the improvement of the Game's graphical appearance
================================================================================

## File: SpaceInvaders.properties
    - Add more images to the "invader" property, allowing for more fluid movement
    - Add an image specifically for when the invader is launching a missile

## File: model/Invader.java
    - Double the drawing frequency (so the Invader image is updated twice as often)
        Previous:
            public static final int CHANGE_FREQ = 12;
        New:
            public static final int CHANGE_FREQ = 6;
    - Update the invader's drawing every Invader::update() call
    - BUT only update the Invader's movements (or other actions) every second update()
        - This ensures that the gameplay and behaviour of the Invaders doesn't change,
          since we doubled the update frequency

Question A6Q2 - 2. Planning the feature that allows users to set their controls
================================================================================

## File: SpaceInvaders.properties
    - Add row: move_left_key="A"
    - Add row: move_right_key="D"
    - Add row: fire_laser_key="SPACE"
    - Add row: pause_key="ESCAPE"
        - these will be configurable by the user (outside of the application)

## File: control/Controls.java
    - Add four private variables (ints) for the configurable control keys
        - KEY_MOVE_LEFT
        - KEY_MOVE_RIGHT
        - KEY_FIRE_LASER
        - KEY_PAUSE
    - Modify keyReleased() so that it uses the private variables in the switch statement,
      not the hardcoded values like KeyEvent.VK_A, etc.
    - Add a method that uses PropertiesDiskStorage to scan for the four "_key"
      properties that determine the user's controls
        - Invoke this method during initialization
        - It will set four private variables that will be used in the keyReleased()
          method to perform actions in the game
        - Something like:
            String keyNameMoveLeft = PropertiesDiskStorage.getInstance().getProperty("move_left_key");
        - Would need a way of converting the string input into a KeyEvent KeyCode value.
            - Could use a (lengthy) switch statement - simpliest solution, but not elegant
                - Might be able to "offload" this to a different (new?) class, to avoid
                  clutter in the Controller class.
            - Might be able to call some lookup table that converts string names to KeyCodes
                - Will investigate further
                - Oh, it's just ASCII! I might be able to use that to my advantage 
    
## File: model/GameObject.java
    - Would need to modify loadImageNames() so that it only loads image files
        - i.e. it would ignore the move_left_key line, etc.

BONUS:
    - Add another interface element that would allow the user to SET the controls
      from WITHIN the game, instead of having to edit the configuration directly.
      - This would involve writing to the SpaceInvaders.properties file, which would
        pose its own set of risks and challenges (but shouldn't be that hard)


================================================================================
Question A6Q2 - 3. Planning the new "NUKE" weapon implementation
================================================================================

## File: SpaceInvaders.properties
    - Add row: fire_nuke_key="F"
